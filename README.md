# LangGraph Concepts & Beginner Codes Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook documenting my journey into LangGraphâ€”a framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications with language models. It includes key concepts, beginner-level code examples, and practical experiments, utilizing **Groq's Free API** for various available models.

## **Overview**
This notebook serves as a hands-on guide for beginners to learn how LangGraph works. Inspired by the official LangGraph tutorials, it explores the following topics:

- Building an LLM application using Groq's (free) LLM models.
- Integrating external tools (like the Tavily search tool) to enhance chatbot capabilities.
- Enabling persistent memory via checkpointing to support multi-turn conversations.
- Incorporating human oversight in the execution loop (human-in-the-loop).
- Customizing and extending the state schema for advanced workflows.
- Implementing time travel to rewind or branch conversation history.

## **Part 1: Getting Started**
Learn how to initialize a StateGraph, add nodes and edges, and compile your graph to create a basic chatbot.<br>
*Detailed code and explanations are provided in the notebook.*


## **Part 2: Adding Tools**
Enhance the chatbot by binding external tools (like the Tavily search engine) to your LLM. This enables the chatbot to answer queries beyond its built-in knowledge.


## **Part 3: Adding Memory**
Implement persistent checkpointing so that the chatbot remembers past interactions, enabling coherent multi-turn conversations.


## **Part 4: Human-in-the-Loop**
Incorporate human oversight into your workflow. The chatbot can pause execution for manual review or confirmation before resuming.<br>
_Build a chatbot that can pause execution, await human input, and then resume processing._


## **Part 5: Customizing Graph State**
Customize and extend the state schema to include additional information (e.g., user details) to support more complex application logic.<br>
_Learn how to customize state handling to support more complex workflows._


## **Part 6: Time Travel**
Implement time travel functionality to rewind to previous conversation states or branch off new execution paths for debugging and experimentation. <br>
*Use checkpointing to "rewind" to previous states and explore alternative conversation paths.*

## **How to Run**
1 .Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name.git
cd your_repo_name
```

2. Install Required Packages:

  Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -U langgraph langsmith langchain_anthropic tavily-python
```

3. Set Up API Keys:

  The notebook requires API keys (e.g., for Anthropic and Tavily). The code includes a helper function to prompt for these if they are not already set in your environment.

4. Run the Notebook:

  Open the Jupyter Notebook (e.g., using Jupyter Lab or Notebook) and execute the cells sequentially.
